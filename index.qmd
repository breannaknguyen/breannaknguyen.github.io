Hi! I am currently a senior research data tech in the Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab at Duke University. I have a strong passion for research and am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I aim to apply to PhD programs this upcoming cycle. I am broadly interested in moral cognition, computational ethics, and data science.
